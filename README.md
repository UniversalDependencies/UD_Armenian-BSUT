# Summary

A Universal Dependencies treebank for Eastern Armenian developed for UD originally at the Brusov State University in Yerevan.

# Introduction

The UD_Armenian-BSUT treebank is based on the Eastern Armenian section of the Հայերենի ծառադարան dataset (ArmTDP V2.0), a broad-coverage corpus of general Modern Standard Armenian covering numerous genres.

The annotation scheme was developed in accordance with the UD guidelines. The original data was manually annotated by the ArmTDP team. The tokenization and POS-tagging process was carried out through alternating steps of glossary-based automatic scripting and manual revision.

# Acknowledgments

This treebank is developed in the frame of the program "HayLingvoTech" excellency center implemented by the V. Brusov State University with the funding of the Competitive Innovation Fund of Armenia.

The treebank created by: Marat M. Yavrumyan, Rima R. Grigoryan, Anna S. Danielyan, Setrag H. M. Hovsepian
